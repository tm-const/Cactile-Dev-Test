## Project Instructions:

Create a WordPress theme based off of the provided design mock-up using the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Plugin which is already installed on the
site. Use ACF for all site content: images, text, links, etc. You may view the plugin documentation at this link:

## Your project must use the following elements:

- Use Advanced Custom Fields for all site content
- Use WordPress menus to organize the site’s header and footer links
- Header links should anchor to the sections on the page with a smooth scrolling animation
- Use a Custom Post Type and categories/taxonomies to organize the plants and query them in the section where they show in the design
- Logos and social icons should be added to the site as SVGs
- Add hover effects to buttons, links, and social icons... Get creative with this one!
- Make your site responsive and viewable on any device

## Bonus Points

- display: flex;
- no css library
- github repository

Please note that this test project is only a one page site, so any buttons on the site won’t have to link out to any other pages.
Please do not use any other WordPress plugins to build your site. 

This project is meant to define your skill level with custom WordPress development.

A JavaScript slider plugin like Slick Slider may be used to achieve the image slider functionality on the site.

Even though we are going to be looking at the visual outcome of the site, we are also going to be looking for a clean and organized code structure.

When you are finished and ready to submit your project, make sure all your code is uploaded to the server so we can make a proper assessment.
